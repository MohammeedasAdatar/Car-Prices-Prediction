# Car-Prices-Prediction

We would be working with the car prices prediction data and looking for the predictions of different kinds of cars. We would be first visualizing the data and understanding some of the information that is very important for predictions. We would be using different regression techniques to get the average price of the car under consideration.

We would be working with quite a large data which contain about 10000 data points where again we would be dividing that into training set and the test set respectively. 

Having a look at some of the cars that we are always excited to use in our daily lives, it is better to understand how these cars are being sold and their average prices respectively. 

Here are the images of some of the cars that we have used in our predictions respectively. There are many other cars that are not included in the pics below. But feel free to have a look at all the images of different varieties of cars.
